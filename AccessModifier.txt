Types of Access Modifier:

  1.Public Access Modifier
  2.Private Access Modifier
  3.Protected Access Modifier
  4.Default Access Modifier
  
  Significance of public access modifier:
  
    When an element is declared as public, it means that it is accessible from anywhere.
    For example:public class can be accessed by any other class in any package.
    A public method or variable can be accessed by any other class or method in any package.
    
  Significance of private access modifier:
   
    When an element is declared as private, it means that it is accessible only within the class where it is defined
    For example, a private class can only be used as a nested class inside another class. 
    A private method or variable can only be accessed by other methods or constructors in the same class, but not by those in other classes or subclasses.
    
  Significance of protected access modifier:
    
    When an element is declared as protected, it means that it is accessible within the same package or by subclasses in other packages. 
    For example, a protected class can only be used as a nested class inside another class or subclass.
    A protected method or variable can be accessed by other classes or methods in the same package, or by subclasses or overridden methods in other packages, 
    but not by those in other classes that are not subclasses.
    
    
  Significance of Default access modifier:
     
     When no access modifier is specified, the element has the default access modifier. 
     It means that the element is accessible only within the same package. 
     For example, a default class can be accessed by other classes in the same package, but not by classes in other packages. 
     Similarly, a default method or variable can be accessed by other classes or methods in the same package, but not by those in other packages.
